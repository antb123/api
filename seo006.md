```

Request Parameters:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset_code` | string | The code of the asset the user wants to deposit with the anchor. Ex BTC,ETH,USD,INR,etc. This may be different from the asset code that the anchor issues. Ex if a user deposits BTC and receives MyBTC tokens, `asset_code` must be BTC.
`account` | `G...` string | The stellar account ID of the user that wants to deposit. This is where the asset token will be sent.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) type of memo that anchor should attach to the Stellar payment transaction, one of `text`, `id` or `hash`
`memo` | string | (optional) value of memo to attach to transaction, for `hash` this should be base64-encoded.
`email_address` | string | (required) Email address of depositor. If desired, an anchor can use this to send email updates to the user about the deposit. 
`type` | string | (optional default = SEPA) Type of deposit. If the anchor supports multiple deposit methods (e.g. `SEPA` or `SWIFT`), the wallet should specify `type`.

Example:

```
curl -v -X GET "https://api.tempo.eu.com/t1/deposit?asset_code=EURT&account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI&email_address=atest@gmail.com"

OR

#### 2. Success: no additional information needed

Response code: `200 OK`

This is the correct response if the anchor is able to execute the deposit and needs no additional information about the user. 
It should also be used if the anchor requires information about the user, but the information has previously been submitted and accepted.

## Withdraw

This operation allows a user to redeem an asset currently on the Stellar network for the real asset (BTC, USD, stock, etc...) via the anchor of the Stellar asset.

The withdraw endpoint allows a wallet to get withdrawal information from an anchor, so a user has all the information needed to initiate a withdrawal. It also lets the anchor specify additional information (if desired) that the user must submit via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md) to be able to withdraw.

### Request

```
GET TRANSFER_SERVER/withdraw
```

Request parameters:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | string | Type of withdrawal. Can be: `crypto`, `bank_account`, `cash`, `mobile`, `bill_payment` or other custom values
`asset_code` | string | Code of the asset the user wants to withdraw. This must match the asset code issued by the anchor. Ex if a user withdraws MyBTC tokens and receives BTC, the `asset_code` must be MyBTC.
`dest` | string | The account that the user wants to withdraw their funds to. This can be a crypto account, a bank account number, IBAN, mobile number, or email address.
`dest_extra` | string | (required) Extra information to specify withdrawal location. For crypto it may be a memo in addition to the `dest` address. It can also be a routing number for a bank, a BIC, or the name of a partner handling the withdrawal.
`account` | `G...` string | (required) The stellar account ID of the user that wants to do the withdrawal. This is only needed if the anchor requires KYC information for withdrawal. The anchor can use `account` to look up the user's KYC information.
`memo` | string | (optional) A wallet will send this to uniquely identify a user if the wallet has multiple users sharing one Stellar account. The anchor can use this along with `account` to look up the user's KYC info.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`

Example:

```
curl -v -X GET https://api.tempo.eu.com/t1/withdraw?asset_code=EURT&dest=FR123123123&dest_extra=BX123132&type=bank_account&account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI
```

### Response

There are five possible kinds of response, depending on whether the anchor needs more information about the user, how it should be sent to the anchor, and if there are any errors.



#### 1. Success: no additional information needed

Response code: `200 OK`

This is the correct response if the anchor is able to execute the withdrawal and needs no additional information about the user. It should also be used if the anchor requires information about the user, but the information has previously been submitted and accepted.

The response body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`account_id` | `G...` string | The account the user should send its token back to.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) type of memo to attach to transaction, one of `text`, `id` or `hash`
`memo` | string | (optional) value of memo to attach to transaction, for `hash` this should be base64-encoded.
`eta` | int | (optional) Estimate of how long the withdrawal will take to credit in seconds.
`min_amount` | float | (optional) Minimum amount of an asset that a user can withdraw.
`max_amount` | float | (optional) Maximum amount of asset that a user can withdraw.
`fee_fixed` | float | (optional) If there is a fee for withdraw. In units of the withdrawn asset.
`fee_percent` | float | (optional) If there is a percent fee for withdraw.
`extra_info` | object | (optional) Any additional data needed as an input for this withdraw, example: Bank Name

Example:

```json
{
  "account_id": "GBTPRPPKDWFZTWMOPNG6OLVU3HYUEIP7OOWQZRRJ72E72GY6UDMOZEUR",
  "memo_type": "text",
  "memo": "D20180901B123"
}
```



### 2. Customer information needed (interactive)

Response code: `403 Forbidden`

An anchor that requires the user to fill out information on a webpage hosted by the anchor should use this response. A wallet that receives this response should open a popup browser window to the specified URL.

The response body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | string | Always set to `interactive_customer_info_needed`
`url` | string | URL hosted by the anchor. The wallet should show this URL to the user either as a popup or an iframe.
`interactive_deposit` | boolean | (optional) false.



Example:

```json
{
  "type": "interactive_customer_info_needed",
  "url": "https://tempo.eu.com/test/withdraw&email_address=atest@gmail.com&key=GBTPRPPKDWFZTWMOPNG6OLVU3HYUEIP7OOWQZRRJ72E72GY6UDMOZEUR",
}
```
